# Unhandled Exceptions and JSON Parsing Errors in Dart

This repository demonstrates common code errors in Dart related to unhandled exceptions during asynchronous operations and improper handling of JSON data.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that showcases these issues. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected and improved version.

## Bug Description
The original code lacks robust error handling for network requests and JSON parsing.  It could crash unexpectedly if the API request fails or if the JSON response is malformed or doesn't contain expected fields. This is especially problematic in asynchronous operations.  The solution improves error handling and makes the JSON parsing more resilient.

## Solution
The solution improves the code in the following ways:
* **Improved Exception Handling**: More comprehensive exception handling is implemented using `try-catch` blocks to gracefully handle errors and prevent crashes.
* **Robust JSON Parsing**:  The code now handles cases where expected JSON fields might be missing or have unexpected values, using the null-aware operator (`??`) and type checking. 
* **Clearer Error Messages**:  More informative error messages help with debugging and troubleshooting.
